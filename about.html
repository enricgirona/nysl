              The Northside Youth Soccer League aspires to develop strong,
              well-rounded, and mindful athletes through the building of
              character, self-discipline, and leadership.

            <p>
              The Northside Youth Soccer League was established in 1996 to
              provide athletes residing in Chicago's northside neighborhood an
              environment to learn and play soccer. To be a member of NYSL, you
              must be between the ages of 4-12 and reside in a Chicago northside
              neighborhood. NYSL is run by a small, full-time staff, and relies
              on the generous volunteer time of parents and former league
              members.
